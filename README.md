# Amazon-Bot-Automation

I have created an automation bot for Amazon.com. Here is what my code simply does:

- it logs in to amazon.com,
- searches for an item of your choice (in my code it is "samsung", you can change this string to any item you want),
- goes to 2nd page of the results (you can change to any page number in the results),
- selects the third item in the page (you can select any item number in the list),
- adds this item to wishlist,
- then goes to wishlist and delete this item.
- Users can change name of the item to be searched, go to any page in the results and select any item in that page.
- This bot is written to automate the end user activities of the website.
